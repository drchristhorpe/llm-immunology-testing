        "CD1 (Cluster of Differentiation 1) proteins are cell surface receptors that play an essential role in presenting antigens to T cells, a key step in adaptive immunity. They do this by binding to specific epitopes on antigenic molecules and presenting them to T cells through their MHC class I (major histocompatibility complex) molecules. This process is crucial for the activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which are responsible for recognizing and eliminating infected or cancerous cells.",

They do this by binding to specific epitopes on antigenic molecules and presenting them to T cells through their MHC class I (major histocompatibility complex) molecules. CD1 proteins are expressed on the surface of various cell types, including dendritic cells, B cells, macrophages, and some cancer cells, among others. The specific function of each type of CD1 protein can vary depending on the context in which it is expressed.",
