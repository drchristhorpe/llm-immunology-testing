        "MAIT (Mucosa-Associated Invariant T) cells are a type of T cell that plays an important role in the immune system's defense against pathogens. They recognize stress-induced self-peptides presented by MHC class I molecules, which are typically only expressed on the surface of epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces such as the gut and respiratory tract. MAIT cells have a unique ability to migrate from the bloodstream into these tissues in response to pathogens or inflammation, where they can help clear infections and prevent chronic inflammatory diseases.",
        "MAIT (Mucosa-Associated Invariant T) cells are a type of T cell that plays an important role in the immune system's defense against pathogens. They recognize antigens presented on infected or abnormal cells, and help to prevent reinfection by these cells. MAIT cells have a unique set of receptors called invariant T-cell receptors (TCRs), which allow them to identify specific antigens regardless of their source.",
        "MAIT (Mucosa-Associated Invariant T) cells are a type of T cell that plays an important role in the immune system's defense against pathogens. They recognize antigens presented on infected or abnormal cells, and help to prevent reinfection by these cells. MAIT cells have a unique property called \"invariant\" T-cell receptor (TCR) usage, which allows them to recognize a wide range of antigens without being specific for any one particular pathogen.",
        "MAIT (Mucosa-Associated Invariant T) cells are a type of T cell that plays an important role in the immune system's defense against pathogens. They recognize antigens presented on infected or abnormal cells, and have been shown to play a key role in protecting against certain viral infections, such as influenza.",

They recognize stress-induced self-peptides presented by MHC class I molecules, which are expressed on the surface of epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces such as the gut and respiratory tract. MAIT cells have a unique ability to respond rapidly to intracellular pathogens and play an important role in protecting against tuberculosis, influenza, and other infectious diseases.",
