        "CD1 is a complex cell surface receptor that presents antigens to T cells in the context of an MHC class I molecule, which are composed of alpha and beta chains. The ligand for CD1 is typically a peptide derived from intracellular proteins or viral antigenic epitopes.",
        "CD1 is a type I transmembrane protein that presents antigens to T cells in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of immune cells. The ligand for CD1 is typically an exogenous peptide, which binds to the MHC class I molecule and is recognized by the T cell receptor (TCR).",
        "CD1 is a class of transmembrane glycoproteins that are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells. They have a large extracellular domain that can bind to various types of ligands including peptides, lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins. The specificity of CD1 molecules is determined by their variable region (V) which recognizes different epitopes on the bound ligand.",
        "CD1 is a class of transmembrane glycoproteins that present antigens to T cells and are expressed on the surface of APCs (antigen-presenting cells). They have different specificities for various types of ligands, including peptides, lipids, and proteins.",
        "CD1 is a type I transmembrane protein that functions as an MHC class II molecule in the presentation of antigens to T cells. It binds to peptides derived from extracellular proteins and presents them on the cell surface for recognition by CD4+ T cells.",
        "CD1 is a class of transmembrane glycoproteins that are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells. They have a large extracellular domain that interacts with MHC Class I or II molecules to present peptides to T cells or B cells respectively. The cytoplasmic tail of CD1 also contains a domain called the \"ligand-binding\" (LB) motif, which is responsible for binding to specific ligands such as lipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",
        "CD1 is a complex composed of multiple proteins that function as cell surface receptors in the immune system to recognize and present antigens from exogenous sources (such as viruses or bacteria) to T cells. The ligands for CD1 are typically peptides derived from pathogens, which bind to specific regions of the CD1 proteins on the surface of infected host cells.",
        "CD1 is a complex composed of multiple proteins that function as cell surface receptors to recognize and present antigens from exogenous sources, such as pathogens or self-antigens. The CD1 family includes several distinct subunits with different ligands:\n\n* Class I MHC (major histocompatibility complex) proteins are presented by class I CD1 molecules on the surface of almost all nucleated cells in mammals, including humans and other primates. These include HLA-A, -B, and -C, which present antigens derived from intracellular pathogens or self-antigens to T cells.\n* Class II MHC (major histocompatibility complex) proteins are presented by class II CD1 molecules on the surface of professional APCs such as macrophages and dendritic cells, which present antigens derived from extracellular pathogens or self-antigens to T cells. These include HLA-DR (delta), -DP, and -DQ, among others.\n* Phosphatidylserine is presented by class III CD1 molecules on the surface of apoptotic cells, which signal danger to immune cells through activation of the complement system.\n* Viral antigens are also recognized and presented by some CD1 proteins, such as those in the HLA-E/HLA-F complex that present viral antigenic peptides from enveloped RNA viruses like influenza or herpesvirus to CD8+ T cells.\n* Self-antigens are also presented by some CD1 proteins, such as those in the H2-M3 complex that present self-peptide/HLA-A2 antigenic epitopes from melanoma and other tumors to CD4+",
        "CD1 is a type I transmembrane protein that presents antigens to T cells in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of APCs. The ligand for CD1 is typically an exogenous peptide, which binds to the MHC class I heavy chain-binding domain and is processed by proteasomes or other intracellular peptidases in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This process generates a peptide that is presented on the surface of the APC via the transmembrane region. The resulting complex between CD1, MHC class I, and ligand is called an H-2Kb/H-2Ld complex in mice or an HLA-A/B/C complex in humans.",
        "CD1 is a complex cell surface receptor that presents antigens to T cells in the context of an MHC class I molecule, which includes \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-sheet motifs. The peptide antigen is bound by the MHC class I molecule on the surface of the cell, with CD1 then interacting with this complex to present it to T cells in a process called major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation."
