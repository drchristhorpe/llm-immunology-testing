        "Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules are proteins expressed on the surface of cells that play an important role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T-cells. They help determine which foreign substances, such as bacteria or viruses, trigger a response from the immune system and also play a crucial role in regulating autoimmunity.",
        "Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules are proteins expressed on the surface of cells that play an important role in immune recognition and regulation. They present antigens to T-cells, helping them identify and eliminate infected or abnormal cells. MHC class I molecules reside on almost all cell types while MHC class II molecules are found mainly on professional APCs (antigen-presenting cells).",

        "Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules are proteins expressed on the surface of cells that play an important role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T-cells. They are responsible for recognizing and processing foreign substances, such as bacteria or viruses, so they can be detected and eliminated by the immune system. MHC molecules consist of a heavy chain (encoded by an X chromosome) and a light chain (encoded by a Y chromosome), which are produced in the liver and transported to other cells via the bloodstream.",
        "Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules are proteins expressed on the surface of cells that play an important role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T-cells. They are responsible for recognizing and processing foreign substances, such as bacteria or viruses, so they can be recognized by the immune system and eliminated from the body. MHC molecules also help regulate the immune response by ensuring that it is only activated in response to genuine threats, rather than harmless substances.",
