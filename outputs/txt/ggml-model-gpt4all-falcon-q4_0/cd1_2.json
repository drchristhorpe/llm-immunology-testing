        "The human isoforms of CD1 include:\n\n1. CD1a (also known as LFA-3)\n2. CD1b (also known as LFA-2)\n\nCD1a and CD1b are both type I transmembrane glycoproteins that belong to the same family of proteins, known as the Langerhans cell antigen (LCA) family. They play a crucial role in activating T cells, which are immune cells responsible for recognizing and eliminating infected or abnormal cells in the body.\n\nCD1a is expressed on the surface of activated Langerhans cells, while CD1b is expressed on the surface of both Langerhans cells and some other types of immune cells. Both isoforms can bind to a type of protein called HLA class II molecules, which are involved in presenting antigens to T cells for recognition.\n\nTogether, these isoforms help activate the immune response against infections and cancer by presenting antigens from pathogens or abnormal cells to T cells for recognition and elimination.",
        "The human isoforms of CD1 include:\n\n1. HLA-DRB1*01:02\n2. HLA-DRB1*01:04\n3. HLA-DRB1*01:05\n4. HLA-DRB1*01:06\n5. HLA-DRB1*01:07\n6. HLA-DRB1*01:09\n7. HLA-DRB1*01:10\n8. HLA-DRB1*01:11\n9. HLA-DRB1*01:13\n10. HLA-DRB1*01:14\n\nThese isoforms are expressed on the surface of immune cells, including T cells and B cells.",
        "The human isoforms of CD1 include:\n\n1. CD1a (alpha)\n2. CD1b (beta)\n3. CD1c (gamma)\n\nCD1a and CD1b are found on the surface of natural killer cells, while CD1c is found on the surface of some T cells.",

        "The human isoforms of CD1 include:\n\n1. CD1a (MHC class I molecule)\n2. CD1b (MHC class I molecule)\n3. CD1c (MHC class I molecule)\n\nEach isoform has a different function and expression level in the body.",
        "The human isoforms of CD1 include:\n\n1. HLA-DRB1*01:02\n2. HLA-DRB1*01:04\n3. HLA-DRB1*01:05\n4. HLA-DRB1*01:06\n5. HLA-DRB1*01:07\n6. HLA-DRB1*01:09\n7. HLA-DRB1*01:10\n8. HLA-DRB1*01:11\n9. HLA-DRB1*01:13\n10. HLA-DRB1*01:14\n\nThese isoforms are encoded by different allelic variants of the HLA class I gene, which is located on chromosome 6. The HLA class I genes encode for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins that present antigens to T cells in the immune system.",

Both isoforms play important roles in activating the immune response by presenting antigens to T cells.\n\nReferences:\n\n* [CD1a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD1a)\n* [CD1b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD1b)\n* [Immunoglobulin superfamily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_superfamily)\n\nAnswer summary:\n\nThe human isoforms of CD1 are CD1a and CD1b, both members of the immunoglobulin superfamily."
