        " Molecules called MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) molecules play an important role in the immune system of many animals, including humans. These molecules are responsible for presenting foreign proteins called antigens to the immune system, which helps to identify and eliminate harmful invaders such as viruses and bacteria. The MHC molecules are also involved in the process of transplantation medicine, where organs or tissues from one person can be transplanted into another person to help them survive or recover from a serious illness.",

These molecules are responsible for presenting foreign proteins called antigens to the immune system, which helps to identify and fight off harmful invaders such as viruses and bacteria. The MHC molecules are also involved in transplantation medicine by allowing doctors to match donors and recipients based on their compatibility.",
        " Molecules called MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) molecules play an important role in the immune system of many animals, including humans. These molecules are responsible for presenting foreign proteins called antigens to the immune system, which helps protect the body from harmful pathogens and infections. The MHC molecules are highly complex and vary greatly between different species, making it difficult for viruses or other foreign invaders to evade the immune system by hiding in these molecules.",
        " Molecules called MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) molecules play an important role in the immune system of many animals, including humans. These molecules are responsible for presenting foreign proteins to our immune cells, which helps us recognize and fight off infections from viruses and bacteria. They also help regulate the strength of our immune response, allowing us to distinguish between \"self\" and \"non-self\" antigens.",
