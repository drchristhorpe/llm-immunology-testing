        " CD1 molecules presentligands that are either carbohydrates or polypeptides. These ligands can be further classified into different subtypes based on their chemical structure and function. For example, some common examples of carbohydrate-based ligands include mannose, galactose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). On the other hand, polypeptide-based ligands can be further classified into different families such as immunoglobulins, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. These proteins play important roles in regulating various biological processes such as immune response, inflammation, cell proliferation, and differentiation.",
        " CD1 molecules presentligands that are specific to the protein molecule they are attached to. For example, CD1 molecules can bind to proteins such as CD3, CD4, and CD8. These proteins are important components of the immune system and play a crucial role in recognizing and attacking foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria.",
        " CD1 molecules present on the surface of cells are composed of two subunits, or \"protein modules,\" that come together to form a complex. These modules belong to different families and can bind to different types of antigens. Specifically, CD1 molecules can recognize proteins that have one or more Ig-like domains (also known as V-domains) on their surface. This allows them to interact with a wide range of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites.",
        " CD1 molecules present various types of ligands such as proteins and carbohydrates. These ligands are involved in the recognition and binding of cells to each other, which is essential for many biological processes like immune response, cell-cell communication, and tissue repair.",
        " CD1 molecules present different types of ligands such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. These ligands are recognized by the immune system through their specific binding to CD1 molecules on the surface of cells. The interaction between these ligands and CD1 molecules triggers a variety of immune responses, including the production of cytokines and chemokines that recruit and activate various immune cells.",
        " CD1 molecules typically recognize specific proteins on the surface of cells through their two extracellular Ig domains. These domains are responsible for binding to carbohydrates and other molecules that decorate the surfaces of target cells. The intracellular part of the molecule contains a single tyrosine kinase domain, which is involved in signal transduction once the CD1 molecule binds to its target cell.",
        " CD1 molecules typically present two types of ligands: proteins and carbohydrates. Proteins are complex molecules that can bind to CD1 molecules through their two extracellular Ig domains, which recognize specific protein-protein interactions. Carbohydrates are organic molecules that can bind to CD1 molecules through their lectin domain, which recognizes specific carbohydrate structures on the surface of cells.",
        " CD1 molecules presentligands that are specific to the protein Fc\ufffd\ufffdRIII (CD16a) and Fcgrg1 (CD16b). These two proteins are members of the IgG-like superfamily and play important roles in immune response.",
        " CD1 molecules presentligands that are specific to the protein Fc\ufffd\ufffdRIII (CD16a) and CD16b. These two proteins are members of the IgG-like superfamily and are expressed on activated macrophages, dendritic cells, and some T cells. They recognize and bind to certain types of immune complexes formed when these cells capture pathogens or foreign molecules. The binding of these ligands to CD16a/b receptors triggers a signal that promotes the activation and maturation of phagocytes, leading to an inflammatory response.",
        " CD1 molecules present on the surface of cells are typically composed of two subunits that come together to form a heterodimer. The two subunits are different in shape and function, with one subunit containing a variable region (V-region) and the other containing a constant region (C-region). The V-region is responsible for binding to specific proteins or antigens, while the C-region plays a role in stabilizing the complex. CD1 molecules can also bind to certain types of carbohydrates, which are important for their recognition by immune cells."
