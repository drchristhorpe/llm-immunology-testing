        " There are three primary human isoforms of CD1: CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c. CD1a is a membrane protein that is expressed on the surface of monocytes and dendritic cells. It plays a role in the initial interaction between immune cells and foreign particles or pathogens. CD1b is also a membrane protein that is expressed on B cells and is involved in the recognition and response to self-antigens. Finally, CD1c is an intracellular protein that is found in both monocytes and dendritic cells and plays a role in the regulation of immune responses.",
        " There are several different human isoforms of CD1, which include CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c. These isoforms differ in their protein sequence and function. CD1a is a type I membrane protein that is expressed on the surface of monocytes and natural killer cells. It has been suggested to play a role in the recognition and killing of intracellular pathogens. CD1b is also a type I membrane protein, but it is expressed on dendritic cells and is involved in the presentation of antigens to T cells. Finally, CD1c is a type II membrane protein that is expressed on natural killer cells and is believed to be involved in the recognition and killing of virus-infected or transformed cells.",
        " There are three primary human isoforms of CD1: CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c. CD1a is a type I membrane protein that is expressed on the surface of activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. CD1b is also a type I membrane protein that is primarily found on B cells and some NK cells. Finally, CD1c is a type II transmembrane protein that is expressed on monocytes and dendritic cells. All three CD1 isoforms play important roles in the immune system by recognizing and binding to antigens presented on the surface of target cells.",
        " There are several different human isoforms of CD1, which are proteins that have similar structures but differ in their functions and activities. The main isoform of CD1 found in most humans is CD1a, also known as HLA-A2 or class I histocompatibility molecule A. This is the protein that plays a key role in the immune system's recognition of foreign invaders such as pathogens. Another important human isoform of CD1 is CD1b, which is involved in the presentation of certain proteins to T cells and helps activate an immune response. Finally, there is also CD1d, which is responsible for the transport of certain sugars and other molecules between cells.",

It plays a role in the initial recognition of foreign antigens by the immune system. CD1b is also a type I membrane protein that is expressed on B cells and plasma cells. It helps to stimulate the production of antibodies. Finally, CD1c is a type II membrane protein that is expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. It functions as an activator of NK cells and plays a role in the regulation of immune response.",
        " There are several different human isoforms of CD1, which are proteins that have similar structures but differ in their functions and activities. The main isoform of CD1 found in most humans is CD1a, also known as HLA-A2 or major histocompatibility complex class I. This is a protein that plays an important role in the immune system by recognizing and presenting foreign antigens to other cells for destruction. Another isoform of CD1 is CD1b, which is found on some individuals but not all. It is also known as HLA-B2 or minor histocompatibility complex class I. This protein plays a role in the immune system by recognizing and presenting self antigens to cells for destruction. Finally, there is CD1d, which is found on most individuals but is only expressed during certain stages of development. It is also known as HLA-DR2 or minor histocompatibility complex class II. This protein plays a role in the immune system by presenting self antigens to cells for destruction.",

It plays a role in the initial interaction between immune cells and foreign particles or antigens. CD1b is also a membrane protein that is found on the surface of B cells, but it does not have any known function. Finally, CD1c is a soluble form of CD1 that can be found in the bloodstream. It acts as an adhesion molecule and plays a role in the homing of immune cells to specific tissues or organs.",
        " There are three main human isoforms of CD1: CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c. CD1a is a type I transmembrane protein that is expressed on the surface of activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. It plays an important role in the recognition and lysis of virus-infected or transformed cells. CD1b is also a type I transmembrane protein that is found on the surface of B cells and some other immune cells. It functions as a receptor for certain types of antigen-presenting cells, helping to activate these cells and promote an immune response. Finally, CD1c is a membrane-bound protein that is expressed on dendritic cells and other immune cells. It plays a role in the presentation of antigens to T cells, promoting an immune response when presented with certain types of proteins.",

It plays a role in the initial interaction between these cells and other immune system components. CD1b is also a membrane protein that is found on the cell surface of B cells. It helps to differentiate self-reactive B cells from non-self-reactive ones, which is important for the development of immunoglobulins. Finally, CD1c is a soluble protein that can be found in the bloodstream and is involved in the regulation of immune response activity.",

It plays a role in the initial recognition of foreign antigens by the immune system. CD1b is also a type I transmembrane protein, but it is found on the surface of activated T cells. CD1c is a short-lived cell surface protein that is expressed on a subset of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. It has been suggested to play a role in the regulation of immune response."
