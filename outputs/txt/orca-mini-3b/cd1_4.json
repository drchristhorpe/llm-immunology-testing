        " CD1 molecules are expressed on certain types of immune cells, including dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and some T cells. They are also found on the surface of activated B cells, which are a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in the body's immune response to foreign invaders such as bacteria or viruses.",
