        " CD1 molecules are proteins that belong to the immune system's leukocyte antigen (LA) family. They are found on the surface of certain types of white blood cells, such as natural killer (NK) and T cells. The function of CD1 molecules is to help the immune system identify and attack foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria.",
        " CD1 molecules are proteins that belong to the immune system's leukocyte antigen (LA) family. They are expressed on the surface of certain types of white blood cells, including natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. CD1 molecules play an important role in recognizing and attacking foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria, as well as cancer cells.",
        " CD1 molecules are proteins that belong to the immune system's leukocyte antigen (LA) family. They are found on the surface of certain types of white blood cells, such as natural killer (NK) and T cells. The function of CD1 molecules is to help the immune system identify and attack foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria. Each type of CD1 molecule has a specific specificity for different pathogens, which allows the immune system to target only the harmful agents while avoiding harmless ones.",
        " CD1 molecules are proteins that belong to the immune system's B cell receptors (BCR) family. They are found on the surface of B cells and are responsible for identifying and binding to antigens, which are foreign substances that the body encounters in the environment. Once a CD1 molecule has bound to an antigen, it triggers the B cell to activate and produce antibodies, which help the immune system fight off harmful invaders such as viruses or bacteria.",
        " CD1 molecules are proteins that belong to the immune system's leukocyte antigen (LA) family. They are found on the surface of certain types of white blood cells, such as natural killer (NK) and T cells. The function of CD1 molecules is to help identify and target specific cells or organisms for destruction by the immune system.",

        " CD1 molecules are proteins that belong to the immune system's leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II complex. They play an important role in identifying and presenting foreign antigens, such as viruses or bacteria, to T cells for attack. This process is known as cross-presentation. CD1 molecules are found on the surface of white blood cells, specifically on dendritic cells and NK cells.",
        " CD1 molecules are proteins that belong to the immune system's leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II complex. They play an important role in identifying and presenting foreign antigens, such as viruses or bacteria, to T cells for attack. The CD1 molecule is a type I integral membrane protein that contains multiple immunoglobulin-like domains, which are responsible for binding to specific antigens. It also has several other functional domains, including an extracellular domain that can bind to MHC class II molecules on the surface of APC cells, and a transmembrane domain that separates the extracellular and intracellular regions.",
        " CD1 molecules are proteins that belong to the immune system's leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II complex. They play an important role in identifying and matching donor cells with recipient cells during transplantation procedures, such as organ transplants. The specificity of CD1 molecules is determined by their amino acid sequence, which varies between individuals due to genetic differences. These molecules are also involved in the recognition and elimination of pathogens and abnormal cells, helping to maintain immune homeostasis.",
        " CD1 molecules are proteins that belong to the immune system's B cell antigen receptor (BCR) family. They are found on the surface of B cells and recognize foreign antigens, such as viruses or bacteria, that have entered the body. When a CD1 molecule identifies a foreign particle, it signals for the release of an immune response, which can include the production of antibodies and the activation of other immune cells."
