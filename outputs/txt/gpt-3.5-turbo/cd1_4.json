        "CD1 molecules are expressed by a specific group of cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These APCs include dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. CD1 molecules are unique as they have the ability to present lipid antigens to T cells. This is in contrast to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules that present protein antigens. CD1 molecules play a critical role in the immune response against pathogens, particularly those that have lipid-based antigens. They activate T cells, which in turn can stimulate the production of cytokines to enhance the immune response and help eliminate the infectious agent. CD1 molecules are also involved in regulating the immune system and can influence various immune processes, such as the development of regulatory T cells and the production of antibodies. Overall, understanding the expression and function of CD1 molecules is important for studying immune responses and developing therapies for infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders.",
        "CD1 molecules are expressed by a specific group of cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This includes dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. These cells play a crucial role in the immune response by presenting antigens to T cells. CD1 molecules are unique because they can present lipid antigens to specialized T cells called CD1-restricted T cells. This allows the immune system to recognize and respond to a wide range of lipid-based pathogens or tumor cells. In addition to their role in immune defense, CD1 molecules are also involved in lipid metabolism and tissue homeostasis.",
        "CD1 molecules are a group of cell surface proteins that play a role in presenting lipid antigens to the immune system. They are predominantly expressed by a specific subset of immune cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which include dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. These cells are important in initiating and regulating immune responses. CD1 molecules are also expressed on a smaller number of non-immune cells, such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and certain subsets of T cells. The expression of CD1 molecules on different cell types allows for the presentation of a variety of lipid antigens, leading to the activation of specific immune responses. Overall, the expression of CD1 molecules is essential for the recognition and response to lipid antigens by the immune system.",
        "CD1 molecules are expressed by a type of immune cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs), specifically, dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. These cells play an important role in presenting lipid antigens to a particular subset of T cells called CD1-restricted T cells. CD1 molecules are also found on some non-immune cells such as certain epithelial cells, which may have a unique function in lipid antigen presentation. Overall, the expression of CD1 molecules on various cells helps in the recognition and response to lipid antigens by the immune system.",
        "CD1 molecules are expressed by a special group of cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These include dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. APCs play a crucial role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T cells, which then initiates an immune response. CD1 molecules are unique because they are known to bind lipid antigens instead of protein antigens like other major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This allows them to activate a unique subset of T cells called CD1-restricted T cells, which can recognize and respond to lipid antigens. CD1 molecules are primarily involved in immune responses against pathogens that produce lipid antigens, such as certain bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria. They also have a role in the immune response against cancer and autoimmune diseases. So, in conclusion, APCs such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells express CD1 molecules, enabling the immune system to recognize and respond to lipid antigens.",
        "CD1 molecules are expressed on specialized cells of the immune system called antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These include dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. CD1 molecules are unique in that they present lipid antigens rather than peptide antigens, and play a crucial role in recognizing and stimulating immune responses against foreign lipids, such as those found in bacterial and fungal cell walls. By presenting lipid antigens to immune cells called T cells, CD1 molecules are involved in immune surveillance and defense against various infectious diseases and cancer. They also have important implications in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Thus, the expression of CD1 molecules on APCs provides a means for the immune system to detect and eliminate cells that contain foreign lipids, thereby maintaining overall health and immune homeostasis in the body.",
        "CD1 molecules are found mainly on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which include dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. CD1 proteins are a type of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that presents lipid antigens to specialized T cells called invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells. There are five different types of CD1 molecules: CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e. Each CD1 isoform is expressed on different subsets of APCs in different tissues. For example, CD1a and CD1b are expressed on dendritic cells in the skin, while CD1c is found on dendritic cells in other tissues. CD1d is expressed on both dendritic cells and macrophages, and also on B cells. CD1e, on the other hand, is not involved in antigen presentation and is mainly found in the endocytic compartments of APCs. Overall, CD1 molecules are important for the immune system to recognize and respond to lipid antigens.",
        "CD1 molecules are expressed mainly by cells of the immune system called antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These include dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, and B cells. CD1 molecules are not expressed on the surface of all cells in the body like other immune molecules. Instead, they are mainly found on the surfaces of APCs, where they play a crucial role in presenting lipid antigens to T cells. CD1 molecules are specialized for presenting lipid and glycolipid antigens, which are different from the protein antigens typically presented by other immune molecules like major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. By presenting lipid antigens, CD1 molecules help activate a unique subset of T cells called CD1-restricted T cells. These T cells recognize and respond to lipid antigens, contributing to immune responses against various microbial infections, tumors, and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, the expression of CD1 molecules on APCs is important for orchestrating immune responses and plays a vital role in protective immunity.",
        "CD1 molecules are expressed on specialized immune cells known as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These include dendritic cells, monocytes, and B cells. CD1 molecules play a crucial role in presenting lipid antigens, such as lipids derived from bacteria or self-lipids, to immune cells called T cells. This process enables T cells to recognize and respond to these lipid antigens, contributing to immune responses against infections and in some cases, autoimmune diseases. It is important to note that the expression of CD1 molecules can vary depending on the specific cell type and their activation status. Additionally, some CD1 molecules are exclusively found on particular cell types. For example, CD1a is primarily expressed on dendritic cells, while CD1b, CD1c, and CD1d can be found on various types of antigen-presenting cells. Overall, CD1 molecules help bridge the gap between innate and adaptive immunity by presenting lipid antigens to T cells.",
        "CD1 molecules are expressed by a specialized group of cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. These cells play a crucial role in the immune response by presenting lipids and lipid-like molecules to certain types of T cells, known as CD1-restricted T cells. CD1 molecules are not expressed on all cells of the body, but are primarily found on these specific immune cells."
