        "MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) molecules are cell surface proteins found in vertebrates. They play a crucial role in the immune system by presenting small peptide fragments derived from intracellular proteins to T cells. This allows T cells to recognize and respond to infected or abnormal cells. MHC molecules are highly diverse and polymorphic, meaning they vary widely between individuals, which enables them to bind a wide range of peptide antigens. The interaction between MHC molecules and T cells is essential for proper immune function and protection against pathogens.",
        "MHC molecules, also known as major histocompatibility complex molecules, are a group of proteins found on the surface of cells in vertebrates. They play a critical role in the immune system by presenting antigens to immune cells, such as T cells. MHC molecules are highly polymorphic, meaning they vary significantly between individuals, enabling the immune system to recognize and respond to a wide range of pathogens. These molecules are important for immune recognition, self/non-self discrimination, and the initiation of an immune response.",
        "MHC molecules, also known as Major Histocompatibility Complex molecules, are proteins found on the surface of cells in vertebrates. They act as cell surface markers and play a critical role in the immune system by presenting pieces of antigens, such as peptides derived from pathogens or tumor cells, to T cells. This allows T cells to recognize and respond to foreign substances, leading to an immune response. MHC molecules are highly polymorphic, meaning their structures can vary between individuals, and this diversity plays a significant role in determining the specificity of immune responses and influencing individual susceptibility to various diseases.",
        "MHC molecules, or major histocompatibility complex molecules, are a group of proteins found on the surface of cells in vertebrates. They play a crucial role in the immune system by presenting antigens, or molecular fragments from pathogens, to immune cells called T cells. This presentation helps the immune system recognize and respond to foreign substances, such as viruses or bacteria. MHC molecules can also interact with other immune cells, providing important signals to coordinate immune responses. The diversity and specificity of MHC molecules contribute to the overall effectiveness of the immune system in recognizing and eliminating threats to the body.",
        "MHC molecules, or major histocompatibility complex molecules, are a group of cell surface proteins that play a crucial role in the immune system. They are expressed on the surface of most cells in the body and function to present small protein fragments called peptides to T cells. This process, known as antigen presentation, allows T cells to recognize and respond to foreign antigens, such as those derived from viruses or bacteria. MHC molecules are highly polymorphic, meaning they come in many different variants, which enables the immune system to recognize a wide range of antigens. The interaction between MHC molecules and T cell receptors is essential for initiating an adaptive immune response and regulating immune tolerance.",
        "MHC molecules, also known as Major Histocompatibility Complex molecules, are a group of proteins found on the surface of cell membranes. They play a crucial role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T cells, which are a type of white blood cell involved in immune responses. MHC molecules are highly diverse and vary between individuals, contributing to the recognition and elimination of foreign pathogens and the regulation of self-tolerance. Additionally, MHC molecules are involved in the establishment of transplant compatibility and are linked to various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and susceptibility to infectious diseases.",
        "MHC molecules, also known as major histocompatibility complex molecules, are a group of proteins found on the surface of cells in vertebrates. They play a critical role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T cells, which are a type of white blood cell. MHC molecules are highly diverse and are encoded by a large number of genes, allowing for recognition of a wide range of foreign substances, such as bacteria or viruses. This antigen presentation process helps to initiate an immune response and contributes to immune surveillance and defense against pathogens. MHC molecules also play a role in the rejection of transplanted cells and tissues, as they allow the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self cells.",
        "MHC molecules, also known as major histocompatibility complex molecules, are cell surface proteins found in vertebrates. They play a crucial role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T cells. MHC molecules are highly diverse and can bind a wide range of antigens derived from pathogens or from the body's own cells. This presentation helps the immune system recognize and mount immune responses against foreign pathogens or infected cells, while also maintaining self-tolerance to prevent the immune system from attacking healthy cells. MHC molecules are highly polymorphic, meaning they vary between individuals, which contributes to the specificity and effectiveness of immune responses.",
        "Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules are a group of cell surface proteins found in most vertebrates. They play a critical role in the immune system by presenting small fragments of proteins called antigens to the immune cells, particularly T-cells. This process enables T-cells to recognize and mount an immune response against infected or cancerous cells. MHC molecules are highly polymorphic, meaning they exist in many different forms in a population. This diversity allows the immune system to recognize a wide range of antigens, contributing to the specificity and effectiveness of the immune response.",
        "MHC molecules, or Major Histocompatibility Complex molecules, are a group of proteins found on the surface of cells in the immune system of vertebrates. These molecules play a crucial role in presenting fragments of antigens, which are proteins from pathogens or other foreign substances, to T cells. By presenting these antigens, MHC molecules help activate the body's immune response to combat infections or other harmful agents. There are two main classes of MHC molecules, MHC class I and MHC class II, each with a distinct role in the immune response. MHC molecules are highly diverse, with multiple alleles found within populations, allowing for recognition of a wide range of antigens."
