        "CD1 is a protein family involved in immune responses. There are five human isoforms of CD1: CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e. Each isoform is encoded by a different gene. These isoforms are expressed on the surface of certain immune cells and play a role in presenting lipid antigens to other immune cells. CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c are expressed on a type of immune cell called dendritic cells, which are important for initiating immune responses. CD1d is expressed on various immune cell types and is involved in the activation of a type of immune cell called natural killer T cells. CD1e is found primarily inside cells and is involved in the intracellular trafficking of other CD1 isoforms. These isoforms have different roles in the immune system and help the immune system recognize and respond to different types of pathogens.",
        "CD1 is a protein that plays a role in the immune system. There are five known isoforms of human CD1: CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e. Each isoform is encoded by a different gene and has unique characteristics. CD1a is mainly found on the surface of skin cells, while CD1b, CD1c, and CD1d are present on immune cells called dendritic cells. CD1e is found inside cells and helps in processing and presenting lipid antigens. These different isoforms have distinct functions and are involved in recognizing and presenting various types of antigens, such as lipids, to the immune system. By doing so, CD1 isoforms contribute to the immune response against infections and other diseases.",
        "CD1 is a protein family that plays a role in the immune system. In humans, there are five isoforms of CD1 proteins: CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e. These isoforms are expressed on the surface of different types of immune cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Each isoform has a slightly different structure and function.\n\nCD1 proteins are unique because they can present lipid antigens to immune cells. This allows the immune system to recognize and respond to infections by certain bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens. The different isoforms of CD1 have different antigen-binding preferences, meaning they can recognize and present different types of lipids.\n\nOverall, these CD1 isoforms are important for the immune response to infections and play a role in regulating immune cells' activities. They contribute to the body's ability to protect against various pathogens.",

Each isoform is found in different types of cells and has unique functions.\n\nCD1a is primarily expressed in skin and other epithelial tissues and helps in activating T cells against certain lipid antigens. CD1b is found in specialized immune cells called dendritic cells and plays a role in presenting lipid antigens from bacterial sources. CD1c is also found in dendritic cells and helps in presenting lipid antigens from both bacterial and self-derived sources.\n\nCD1d is expressed in a variety of cells, including dendritic cells and some immune cells called B cells and macrophages. It presents lipid antigens to a specialized group of T cells called natural killer T (NKT) cells, which have both immune regulatory and effector functions. CD1e is a less well-studied isoform and its exact function is not yet fully understood, but it is thought to play a role in antigen processing and presentation.\n\nOverall, the different isoforms of CD1 have distinct cellular and immune functions, allowing the immune system to recognize and respond to a wide range of lipid antigens.",
        "The human CD1 family consists of five isoforms: CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e. Each isoform is encoded by a different gene, and they are expressed on the surface of immune cells called antigen-presenting cells. These isoforms play a crucial role in presenting lipids and glycolipids (molecules with both lipid and carbohydrate components) to immune cells called T cells. This presentation helps activate the immune system and elicit appropriate immune responses against infections.\n\nCD1a is primarily expressed on dendritic cells and Langerhans cells, which are found in the skin. CD1b is expressed on monocytes and dendritic cells in various tissues. CD1c is mainly found on certain dendritic cell subsets. CD1d is expressed on various cells, including dendritic cells, B cells, and some epithelial cells. CD1e, although not as extensively studied as the other isoforms, is also expressed on dendritic cells.\n\nThe diversity of CD1 isoforms and their ability to present different lipid antigens contribute to the broad range of immune responses that our immune system can mount against various pathogens.",
        "The CD1 protein family in humans consists of five isoforms: CD1A, CD1B, CD1C, CD1D, and CD1E. These isoforms are important for presenting various lipid antigens to immune cells. CD1A is mainly found on dendritic cells and Langerhans cells in the skin, CD1B is expressed on dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues, CD1C is present on myeloid dendritic cells, CD1D is found on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and B cells, and CD1E is expressed on dendritic cells in certain tissues. Each isoform has a unique function and plays a role in activating the immune response against lipid antigens.",
        "The human CD1 gene family consists of five isoforms: CD1A, CD1B, CD1C, CD1D, and CD1E. Each isoform is expressed on the surface of different types of immune cells, such as dendritic cells and T cells. These isoforms play a critical role in presenting lipid antigens to certain immune cells, initiating immune responses against infections and cancers. The main difference between the CD1 isoforms lies in their ability to bind and present different types of lipid molecules. This diversity allows the immune system to recognize a wide range of lipid antigens and mount specific immune responses. Overall, the CD1 isoforms are important in the immune response and contribute to the recognition and elimination of various pathogens and abnormal cells.",

        "The human CD1 family consists of four isoforms, known as CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, and CD1d. These isoforms are found on the surface of certain cells of the immune system, such as dendritic cells, B cells, and thymocytes. Each isoform has a unique structure and plays a different role in immune responses. CD1a is involved in presenting lipid antigens to T cells, CD1b is involved in presenting mycobacterial and other microbial lipid antigens, CD1c is involved in presenting self and foreign lipid antigens, and CD1d is involved in presenting glycolipid antigens. By presenting these antigens, CD1 molecules aid in the activation of T cells, which are essential in fighting infections and diseases. Understanding the different isoforms of CD1 is important for studying and developing therapies for various immune-related disorders.",

In humans, there are five known isoforms or variants of CD1: CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e. Each isoform has a slightly different structure and function. CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c are mainly involved in presenting lipid antigens to immune cells, activating an immune response against pathogens. CD1d is unique in that it can present glycolipid antigens, activating a different type of immune response called the natural killer T (NKT) cell response. CD1e is a less studied isoform and its function is not yet well understood.
