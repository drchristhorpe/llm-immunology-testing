        "CD1 is a protein found on the surface of cells in the immune system. There are three main isoforms (variants) of CD1 that are expressed by different types of cells in the body: CD1A, CD1B, and CD1C. These isoforms have slightly different structures and functions but all play a role in presenting antigens to T cells and activating the immune response.",
