        "MAIT (Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue) cells are a type of immune cell that play an important role in protecting the body against infections and other harmful invaders. They recognize specific molecules on the surface of pathogens, called heat shock proteins, which are produced when cells are exposed to high temperatures or other stressors. By recognizing these molecules, MAIT cells can trigger an immune response that helps protect against infections and other harmful invaders.",
