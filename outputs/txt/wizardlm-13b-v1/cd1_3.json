        "CD1 molecules are type I transmembrane glycoproteins that function as antigen-presenting complexes in the immune system. They display linear peptide fragments to T cells, which helps initiate and regulate adaptive immune responses. The specific ligands (peptides) presented by CD1 molecules vary depending on the isoform:\n\n* CD1a presents a diverse range of non-polar amino acid residues in the C-terminal portion of the peptide, which may include hydrophobic and/or beta-amyloid sequence motifs.\n* CD1b primarily displays lipopeptides, which are composed of lipids and short peptide fragments. These ligands can originate from bacterial cell walls or other sources.\n* CD1c presents a unique array of hydrophobic amino acid residues in the C-terminal portion of the peptide, often including beta-amyloid sequence motifs and/or other hydrophilic regions flanked by non-polar amino acids.\n* CD1d presents glycosylated lipid antigens, which are derived from various microbial sources or produced endogenously in the host organism. These ligands play a crucial role in activating innate immune responses through their interaction with NKT cells.",
        "CD1 molecules are type I transmembrane glycoproteins that function as antigen-presenting complexes on the surface of immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages. They play a crucial role in initiating adaptive immune responses by presenting processed antigens to T cells. CD1 molecules can interact with various types of ligands or antigens, including lipids (such as phospholipids), peptides, and glycolipids. Specifically, different CD1 subtypes have specificity for particular classes of lipid or glycolipid structures found on pathogens, self-antigens, or other non-self entities. The presentation of these ligands to T cells allows the immune system to recognize and respond to a wide range of potential threats.",
        "CD1 molecules are type I transmembrane glycoproteins that function as antigen-presenting complexes on the surface of various immune cells, including dendritic cells and B cells. They display small lipid or glycolipid molecules called lipids to T cells, which helps activate their immune response. CD1 molecules are divided into five main groups (CD1a-d) based on the type of ligand they present.",
        "CD1 molecules are type I transmembrane glycoproteins that function as antigen-presenting complexes in the immune system. They display lipid and peptide fragments to T cells, thereby playing a crucial role in initiating adaptive immunity responses. CD1 molecules can present various types of ligands, including:\n\n1. Fatty acids (such as myristic acid or palmitic acid) bound to a protein called calcium-binding adapter molecule for lipoylation sites (CAALYX). This complex is presented by CD1d molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, primarily dendritic cells and B cells.\n2. Glycolipids with \u03b1-galactosyl or \u03b1-glucosyl residues bound to a protein called lipophosphoglycan (LPG). CD1b molecules present this complex on the surface of macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils. LPG is primarily derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and can be recognized by T cells, leading to an immune response against the bacteria.\n3. Phosphoantigens, such as those found in Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that causes African sleeping sickness. CD1c molecules present these antigen fragments on the surface of dendritic cells and B cells, which can activate T cells specific for the trypanosome infection.\n4. Structure-based ligands, such as lipopeptides from Gram-positive bacteria or glycosylated viral proteins. CD1 molecules (primarily CD1a and CD1b) can present these complexes to T cells, leading to the development of adaptive immune responses against bacterial infe",
        "CD1 molecules are type I transmembrane glycoproteins that function as antigen-presenting complexes in the immune system. They bind to lipids and peptides, acting as ligands for T cells. Specifically, CD1 molecules can present a variety of lipid-derived antigens, such as fatty acid derivatives (e.g., phosphatidylcholine), glycolipids (e.g., complex carbohydrates bound to lipids), and prenylated proteins (proteins with a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl group attached). These ligands are derived from pathogens, self-antigens, or dietary components, allowing CD1 molecules to activate T cells involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses.",

These lipids are recognized by a specific subset of NKT cells, which play an important role in regulating immune responses and mediating innate immunity.\n2. Non-peptide antigens (e.g., \u03b1-galactosylceramide) bound to CD1 molecules belonging to the CD1 family (CD1a, CD1b, CD1c). These non-peptide ligands are recognized by various immune cells, including dendritic cells and some T cell subsets.\n3. Peptides derived from pathogens or self-antigens bound to MHC molecules in the context of CD1 complexes (CD1d-lipid/CD1a, CD1b, CD1c). These peptide ligands are recognized by various T cell subsets, which can mount an immune response against the pathogen or self-antigen.\n\nIn summary, CD1 molecules present a diverse range of lipid and peptide ligands to different types of immune cells, playing essential roles in initiating adaptive immunity responses and regulating innate immunity.",
