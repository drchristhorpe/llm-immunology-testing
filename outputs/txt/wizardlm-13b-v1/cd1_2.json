        "CD1 proteins consist of two chains: a transmembrane \u03b1-chain and a cytoplasmic \u03b2-chain. There are five major human CD1 genes (CD1A, CD1B, CD1C, CD1D, and CD1E) that encode different combinations of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains. These isoforms present antigens to T cells and play a crucial role in the immune system's recognition of self and non-self molecules.",
        "CD1 proteins are cell surface glycoprotein molecules that play important roles in immune function and recognition. There are two main isoforms of CD1, designated as CD1a and CD1b. These isoforms have distinct genetic origins but share a similar protein structure with a conserved cytoplasmic domain.\n\nCD1a is encoded by the CR2 gene, which has multiple alleles that result in different amino acid sequences of the CD1a molecule. The expression of CD1a varies among individuals and tissues, but it is primarily found on dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, and some B cells.\n\nCD1b, on the other hand, is encoded by the Fc\u03b3RI gene (also known as CRB2) and has a more restricted expression pattern compared to CD1a. It is mainly expressed on monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, and some B cells.\n\nIn summary, there are two main human isoforms of CD1: CD1a (encoded by CR2) and CD1b (encoded by Fc\u03b3RI). These molecules play crucial roles in the immune system by presenting non-peptide antigens to T cells.",

        "CD1 is a group of transmembrane glycoproteins that play important roles in immune cell function and activation. There are two major human isoforms of CD1, known as CD1a and CD1b. These isoforms have slightly different genetic origins but share similar structural features and functions within the immune system. Both CD1a and CD1b can present lipids, peptides, or glycolipids to T cells, helping to regulate their activation and response to various antigens.",

        "CD1 proteins are cell surface glycoprotein molecules that play important roles in immune system function and activation. There are several different forms or isoforms of CD1, which can be classified based on their subunit composition (alpha or beta) and alternative splicing events. Among these human isoforms, the most well-characterized include:\n\n* CD1a\n* CD1b\n* CD1c\n* CD1d",
        "CD1 proteins are cell surface glycoprotein molecules that play an important role in immune response and recognition of self versus non-self cells. There are five major human CD1 isoforms, designated as CD1a to CD1e. These isoforms differ in their extracellular domains (ECDs), which contain the binding sites for lipids and peptides that present antigens to T cells. The specificity of each CD1 isoform comes from its unique ECD, allowing them to recognize different classes of lipid-peptide complexes.",
        "CD1 proteins consist of two chains: \u03b1 and \u03b2. These chains can combine to form different isoforms that have distinct functions in immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. In humans, the CD1 family contains five genes (CD1A, CD1B, CD1C, CD1D, and CD1E), which encode \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains for different isoforms:\n\n* CD1A presents lipid antigens to T cells in association with MHC class II molecules. It forms a complex with the \u03b2 chain of either CD1B or CD1C.\n* CD1B also associates with \u03b1\u03b2 T-cell receptors (TCRs) and presents lipids, peptides, and proteins to T cells in the context of MHC class II molecules. It can form a complex with either the \u03b1 chain of CD1A or the \u03b2 chain of CD1C.\n* CD1C also associates with \u03b1\u03b2 TCRs but has a broader specificity for lipid antigens compared to CD1B and CD1D. Like CD1B, it can form a complex with either the \u03b1 chain of CD1A or the \u03b2 chain of CD1B.\n* CD1D presents glycolipid antigens to NKT cells in association with MHC class I-like molecules. It forms a complex only with the \u03b2 chain of CD1D, which has an unusual structure that allows it to bind specifically to glycosylceramide (GCD) on the surface of lipid particles.\n* CD1E is a rare and poorly characterized isoform in humans. It may also present lipids or other antigens to T cells, NKT cells, or other immune cell types",
