        "Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules are a set of proteins found on the surface of cells in our bodies. They play an essential role in the immune system by helping to identify and eliminate foreign invaders, such as viruses or bacteria. MHC molecules display small fragments of proteins from within the cell, which allows the immune system's T-cells to recognize and respond to potential threats. In summary, MHC molecules are important for recognizing and fighting off infections by helping the immune system identify harmful invaders.",
