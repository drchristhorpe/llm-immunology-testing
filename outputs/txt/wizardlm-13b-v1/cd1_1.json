        "CD1 molecules, also known as cluster of differentiation 1 molecules, are a group of transmembrane proteins found on the surface of immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages. They play an important role in the recognition and presentation of antigens to T-cells, which is crucial for initiating an effective immune response against pathogens or cancer cells. There are several different CD1 molecules, each recognizing a specific class of lipid-bound molecules such as fatty acids, glycolipids, and phospholipid-derived antigens.",

They play an important role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T-cells, which helps to initiate and regulate the adaptive immune response. There are several different CD1 molecules, each recognizing a specific class of lipid-bound antigens found on pathogens or self-antigens in the case of autoimmunity.",

They play an important role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T-cells, which helps to initiate and regulate the adaptive immune response. There are several different CD1 molecules, each recognizing a specific class of lipid-bound molecules called lipopeptides or glycolipids. These molecules help the immune system distinguish between self and non-self cells, allowing for the identification and elimination of foreign invaders while avoiding attack on healthy body tissues.",

They play an important role in the recognition and presentation of antigens to T-cells, which is crucial for initiating an effective immune response against pathogens or cancer cells. There are several different CD1 molecules, each recognizing a specific class of lipid-bound ligands such as fatty acids, glycolipids, and prenylated lipids. These ligands can be derived from microorganisms, plants, or even self-antigens, making the CD1 system an essential component of both innate and adaptive immunity.",
        "CD1 molecules, also known as cluster of differentiation 1 molecules, are a group of transmembrane proteins found on the surface of immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages. They play an important role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T-cells, which helps to initiate and regulate the adaptive immune response. There are several different CD1 molecules, each recognizing a specific class of lipid-bound proteins (lipids) found on pathogens or self-antigens. These lipids are bound to the CD1 molecule through their hydrophobic tails and presented on the cell surface for recognition by T-cell receptors, thereby triggering an immune response against the targeted antigen.",
