        "CD1 molecules are primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells and some subsets of B cells, monocytes, and macrophages. These APCs play a crucial role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T cells, thereby initiating an adaptive immune response.",
        "CD1 molecules are primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), specifically dendritic cells and Langerhans cells, which play a crucial role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T cells. CD1 expression can also be found on some B cells and natural killer (NK) cells, but these are less common compared to APCs.",
