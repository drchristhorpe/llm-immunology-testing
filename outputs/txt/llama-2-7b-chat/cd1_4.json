        " CD1 molecules are expressed on the surface of various immune cells, including:\n\n* T cells (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells)\n* B cells\n* Natural killer cells\n* Neutrophils\n* Eosinophils\n* Basophils\n\nThese cell types express different isoforms of the CD1 molecules, which are involved in various immune functions such as antigen presentation and signaling. The specific isoform expressed can help identify the type of cell it is present on and its functional role in the immune system.",
