        " The CD1 (Cluster of Differentiation) proteins are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins that play important roles in immune cell function and antigen presentation. There are several different human isoforms of CD1, including:\n* CD1a: Expressed on the surface of mature dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, as well as some T cells and B cells.\n* CD1b: Expressed on the surface of DCs and macrophages, but not on T or B cells.\n* CD1c: Expressed on the surface of DCs and macrophages, as well as some T cells and B cells.\n* CD1d: Expressed on the surface of DCs and macrophages, as well as some T cells and B cells.\nEach isoform has a distinct distribution pattern in different tissues and cell types, and they can have slightly different functions within the immune system. For example, CD1a is involved in the presentation of lipid antigens to T cells, while CD1b is more involved in the presentation of glycolipids and glycoproteins.\nIt's worth noting that there are also other subtypes of CD1 proteins, such as CD1e and CD1f, which are expressed on a limited number of cell types and have specialized functions within the immune system.",
