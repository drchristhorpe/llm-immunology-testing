        " CD1 molecules (Cluster of Differentiation 1) are a family of proteins that play a crucial role in the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to foreign substances, such as viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. These proteins are expressed on the surface of immune cells, including T cells and B cells, and act as receptors for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which display pieces of proteins from inside the cell to the outside environment. The CD1 molecules help the immune system recognize these displayed proteins and mount an appropriate response, such as activating T cells or triggering antibody production by B cells. Different types of CD1 molecules (CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, etc.) are expressed on different immune cell subsets and can recognize different epitopes (regions) within the displayed proteins.",
        " CD1 molecules (Cluster of Differentiation 1) are a family of proteins that play a crucial role in the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to foreign substances, such as viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. These proteins are expressed on the surface of immune cells, including T cells and B cells, and act as markers for cellular differentiation and activation. CD1 molecules present pieces of antigens (foreign substances) to T cells, which then recognize and respond accordingly. In addition, CD1 molecules can also interact with other proteins on the surface of immune cells, modulating their activity and function. Overall, CD1 molecules are important for proper immune cell function and play a key role in the immune response.",

These proteins are expressed on the surface of immune cells, including T cells and B cells, and act as markers for cellular differentiation and activation. CD1 molecules can bind to specific antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of infected cells or tumor cells, triggering an immune response that helps eliminate these foreign substances from the body. Different types of CD1 molecules are associated with different immune functions and diseases, making them attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease treatment.",
