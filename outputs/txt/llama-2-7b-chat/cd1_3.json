        " CD1 molecules are known to present a wide range of ligands, including:\n\n* Carbohydrates: CD1a molecules can present self-antigens such as gangliosides and sialylated glycans.\n* Lipids: CD1b molecules can present lipid antigens such as lysoPCs and ceramide.\n* Proteins: CD1d molecules can present exogenous proteins, including viral and bacterial proteins.\nThese ligands are processed and presented to T cells through the action of enzymes in the immune system, leading to an immune response against the foreign antigens.",
        " CD1 molecules are known to present a wide range of ligands, including:\n\n* Carbohydrates: CD1a molecules can present self-antigens such as gangliosides and sialylated glycans.\n* Lipids: CD1b molecules can present lipid antigens such as lipids with a fatty acid tail and a sugar moiety, like ceramide and cerebrosides.\n* Proteins: CD1c molecules can present exogenous proteins that are processed into smaller peptides, which are then presented to T cells.\nThese ligands are processed by the antigen processing machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum and are transported to the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) where they can be recognized by T cells. The specific type of ligand that a CD1 molecule presents depends on the isoform of the protein expressed by the cell.",
        " CD1 molecules are known to present a wide range of ligands, including:\n\n* Carbohydrates: CD1a molecules can present glycans such as N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides.\n* Lipids: CD1b molecules can present lipid antigens such as ganglioside GM1 and GD3.\n* Proteins: CD1d molecules can present protein antigens such as viral proteins like HBV and HPV, and bacterial proteins like LPS from Gram-negative bacteria.\nThese ligands are processed and presented to T cells through the action of enzymes called glycosyltransferases and hydrolases in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The specific type of ligand presented by a given CD1 molecule can vary depending on the cell type and the antigenic context, which is important for immune recognition and response.",
        " CD1 molecules are known to present a wide range of ligands, including:\n\n* Carbohydrates: CD1a molecules can present glycan antigens, such as N-glycosylated proteins and lipid-linked oligosaccharides.\n* Lipids: CD1b molecules can present lipids, such as cholesterol and phospholipids.\n* Proteins: CD1c molecules can present intracellular proteins, including cytokines and growth factors.\n* Peptides: CD1d molecules can present peptide antigens, including self-antigens and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).\nThese ligands are processed and presented to T cells through the action of enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The specific type of ligand presented by a given CD1 molecule can influence the immune response, with some ligands stimulating an immune response while others may suppress it.",
