        " The human isoforms of CD1 are different forms of the same protein that have different functions and structures. There are several human isoforms of CD1, including CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c. Each isoform has a unique structure and function. For example, CD1a is involved in cell signaling and growth factor biology, while CD1b plays a role in apoptosis and cell death. CD1c is involved in the immune system and helps to recognize and attack pathogens.",
        " The human isoforms of CD1 are different variations of the same gene that have different meanings and functions. There are several human isoforms of CD1, including:\n\n1. CD1a: This is a long form of the CD1 gene that does not contain any exons and has a very short amino acid sequence. It is found in some people with autoimmune disorders such as lupus and multiple sclerosis.\n\n2. CD1b: This is another form of the CD1 gene that lacks exons and has a shorter amino acid sequence than CD1a. It is also found in individuals with autoimmune disorders.\n\n3. CD1c: This is a splice variant of the CD1 gene that does not have any exons and has a very short amino acid sequence. It is found in some people with lupus and other autoimmune disorders.\n\n4. CD1d: This is another form of the CD1 gene that lacks exons and has a shorter amino acid sequence than CD1a. It is also found in individuals with autoimmune disorders.\n\n5. CD1e: This is a splice variant of the CD1 gene that does not have any exons and has a very short amino acid sequence. It is found in some people with lupus and other autoimmune disorders.\n\n6. CD1f: This is another form of the CD1",
        " There are several human isoforms of CD1. The most common ones are CD1a and CD1b. CD1a is a transmembrane protein that is found on the surface of red blood cells and plays an important role in their function. It is also known as the \"red cell surface protein\" or \"erythrocyte surface protein.\" CD1b, on the other hand, is a glycosylated protein that is found on the surface of red blood cells and helps to bind with certain antigens.",

CD1a: This is a long form of the CD1 gene that does not contain any exons and has a unique C-terminal domain. It is expressed in white blood cells and plays an important role in immune function.\n\n2. CD1b: This is another long form of the CD1 gene that lacks exons and has a unique N-terminal domain. It is also expressed in white blood cells and has been implicated in certain types of cancer.\n\n3. CD1c: This is a short form of the CD1 gene that contains only one exon and is found in red blood cells. It plays an important role in haemoglobin function and is responsible for the sickle cell trait.\n\n4. CD1d: This is another short form of the CD1 gene that lacks exons and has a unique C-terminal domain. It is expressed in white blood cells and may play a role in immune function.\n\n5. CD1e: This is a long form of the CD1 gene that contains several exons and is found in red blood cells, white blood cells, and other tissues. It plays an important role",

It is expressed in a variety of tissues, including blood cells, brain, and muscle.\n\n3. CD1c: This is a third isoform of CD1 that does not contain any exons and has a very short amino acid sequence. It is found in low-level expression in some tissues, such as blood cells and placenta.\n\n4. CD1d: This is a fourth isoform of CD1 that lacks exons and has a shorter amino acid sequence than CD1b.
